# nion

nion is a library that makes it easy to fetch, update, and manage API data in a Redux store as well as bind it to React components. Nion strives to make working with data as **flexible**, **consistent**, and **predictable** as possible. üíñ

nion is heavily inspired by [Apollo](http://www.apollodata.com/http://www.apollodata.com/) and [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/).

## In a Nutshell üå∞

nion is used as a **decorator function** which declares what data will be managed by the decorated component and passes in props for managing that data.

```javascript
@nion({
    currentUser: {
        endpoint: 'https://patreon.com/api/current_user',
    }
})
class UserContainer extends Component {
    render() {
        const { currentUser } = this.props.nion
        const { request, actions, data } = currentUser

        const loadButton = <Button onClick={() => actions.get()}>Load</Button>

        return (
            <Card>
                { request.isLoading ? <LoadingSpinner /> : loadButton }
                { exists(currentUser) ? <UserCard user={data} /> : null }
            </Card>
        )
    }
}
```

We simply pass in an object with a special [`declaration`](docs/glossary.md#declaration) that tells nion **what** to fetch, and nion automatically handles fetching the data and passing both it and the corresponding request status in as props to the decorated component.

## Up and Running üèÉüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Installation

nion requires `redux-thunk` in order to handle its async actions, so you should install that along with the `nion` package.

```
npm install nion redux-thunk --save
```

Also, nion is best used as a decorator function, so you might also want to make sure you've got babel configured to handle decorator transpilation:

```
npm install babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy --save-dev
```

### Configuration

Finally, nion has to be wired up to the redux store and optionally configured. Here's a very simple setup:

```javascript
import { applyMiddleware, createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux'
import thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk'

import { configureNion } from 'nion'

export default function configureStore() {
    const configurationOptions = {}
    const { reducer: nionReducer } = configureNion(configurationOptions)

    const reducers = combineReducers({
        nion: nionReducer,
    })

    let store = createStore(reducers, applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware))

    return store
}
```
